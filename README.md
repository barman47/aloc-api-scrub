# Clone the Repo and Follow these Steps
* Install Nodejs if you dont't already have it
  * https://nodejs.org and download the one with Long Term Support (Recommended). That should install npm for you too.

* After cloning the repo, open the command line in the project folder and run `npm install`
* Run `node index.js` in the terminal for the script to execute
